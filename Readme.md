# LDTS Project
Minesweeper game developed in Java using gradle to learn more about java, object-oriented programming, design patterns, code testing and code smells. Gradle was used, as well as Laterna to develop the game. It was the first project in which we needed to use git, so version control system usage was also developed. Done with João Proença and Rodrigo Resende.
